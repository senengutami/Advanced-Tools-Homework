            The app allows users to create a profile and input their dietary
            restrictions and flavor preferences. Using this information, the app
            generates personalized recommendations for yogurt brands and flavors
            that the user may enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            n addition to personalized recommendations, the Yogurt app also
            provides users with nutrition information and the ability to search
            for nearby stores that carry their preferred yogurt brands. The app
